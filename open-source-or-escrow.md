## Open Source vs. Escrow-Protected FiveM Scripts

At Ata Scripts , we offer both **open-source** and **escrow-protected** FiveM scripts. Each type serves different needs here’s how they compare.

***

### **What is an Open Source Script?**

An open-source script provides **full access to the source code**, allowing you to modify, customize, and integrate it freely.

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* **Full Code Access** – Edit, rewrite, or extend the script as needed.
* **Unlimited Customization** – Tailor every aspect to fit your server.
* **No Licensing Limits** – Use on multiple servers (check product terms).

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* **Security Risks** – Code can be copied, leaked, or resold illegally.
* **No Piracy Protection** – Harder to prevent unauthorized redistribution.
* **Potential Support Gaps** – Developers may not assist with heavily modified versions.

### **What is an Escrow-Protected Script?**

Encrypted via **FiveM Escrow**, these scripts **only run on licensed servers**, protecting developers and users.

#### ✅ **Advantages**

* **Code Security** – Encryption prevents leaks or unauthorized sharing.
* **Guaranteed Updates** – Developers can push fixes efficiently.
* **Fair Licensing** – One license per server ensures compliance.

#### ❌ **Disadvantages**

* **Restricted Customization** – Core files are locked (config files remain editable).
* **Single-Server Use** – Need separate licenses for additional servers.
* **Developer-Dependent** – Major changes require official updates.

### **Which One Should You Choose?**

| **Priority**                 | **Recommended Type** |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
