# ℹ️ About US


We are a team of two developers who focus on creating and selling budget-friendly, yet high quality FiveM resources.

It gives us pride to say that during this span of time, we have built our name and earned a positive reputation in the FiveM community.

Our business currently hosts over 3,000 members in our Discord server and has thousands of satisfied customers. Our main goal is to listen to community feedback, incorporate their suggestions, and create scripts that cater to a broad FiveM audience. We also continuously improve and optimize our existing scripts by implementing community-driven updates on a regular basis.
